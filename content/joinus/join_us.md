The Lucas Lab is looking for curious, motivated researchers in microbiology and bioinformatics to join our team. Our mission is to:

1. Conduct basic and translational microbiome research.
2. Train undergraduate, graduate, and post-graduate researchers to be interdisciplinary scientists and find success in their chosen career paths.
3. Create an environment that is collaborative, supportive, and inclusive for our team and the Syracuse research community.

# Suos Cultores Scientia Coronat - <br>*Knowedge crowns those who seek her*

Syracuse University is a private, top-tier international research university located in Central New York. The Biology Department at Syracuse University is home to several faculty and researchers with an interest in microbial ecology. This diversity of research programs creates a rich environment for collaboration and training. Our research community extends beyond the SU Biology Department's walls to include both SUNY College of Environmental Science and Forestry and SUNY Upstate Medical University, right down the street from the SU campus.

If you are interested in joining our team, please read the sections below:
